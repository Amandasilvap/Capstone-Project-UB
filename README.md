## Project

### Sumary

This is the closing project of the Postgraduate Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Science course. 

We used the 2022 Recsys Challenge, focuses on fashion recommendations, as the basis of the project. When given user sessions, purchase data and content data about items, can you accurately predict which fashion item will be bought at the end of the session?

### Dataset
As part of this challenge, Dressipi will be releasing a public dataset of 1.1 million online retail sessions that resulted in a purchase. In addition, all items in the dataset have been labeled with content data and the labels are supplied. We refer to the label data as item features. The dataset is sampled and anonymized.

- Sessions: The items that were viewed in a session. In this dataset a session is equal to a day, so a session is one user's activity on one day.
- Purchases: The purchase that happened at the end of the session. One purchased item per session.
- Item features: The label data of items. Things like “color: green,” “neckline: v-neck,” etc.
